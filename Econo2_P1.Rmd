Loading the database and creating dummy variables:

```{r database}

df <- read_excel("RS_USD.xlsx")


names(df)[names(df) == "R$/US$"] <- "p"

names(df)[names(df) == "Variação (em %)"] <- "delta"

names(df)[names(df) == "Data"] <- "date"

sign <- as.numeric(df$delta > 0)

count <- c(1:2153)

df <- data.frame(count, df, sign)



```


Before constructing our models, we need to check (intuitively) if the series at hand is *stationary* and *ergodic*. For this, we're going to plot the time series, its autocovariances and partial autocovariances.

``` {r plots}

p_plot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date, y = p)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("USD/BRL, Price") + theme_few()
p_plot 

delta_plot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date, y = delta)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("USD/BRL, %") + theme_few()
delta_plot 

dummy_plot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = count, y = sign)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("USD/BRL, +/-") + xlim(1,200) + theme_few()
dummy_plot

fac_st <- forecast::Acf(df$delta, type = "covariance", lag.max = 100, plot = T)
fac_lt <- forecast::Acf(df$delta, type = "covariance", lag.max = 5000, plot = T)

facp <- forecast::Pacf(df$delta, lag.max = 5000, plot = T)


?Acf

```

Let's now create our first ARMA models (equivalent to ARIMA with 2nd argument = 0). We'll begin with the first hypothesis: \mathbb{P}(+) = \mathbb{P}(-). Modelling this with an AR(1), we have:

$$Sign_t+1 = c + ar_1*Sign_t + \varepsilon, \hspace{2em} \varepsilon \sim wn(0, \sigma^2)$$
In R, we'll use the package $forecast$ to construct this model:

```{r AR(1)}

AR1 <- Arima(df$sign, order = c(1, 0, 0))
summary(AR1)

plot(AR1)

tsdisplay(AR1$residuals)
?Arima


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
